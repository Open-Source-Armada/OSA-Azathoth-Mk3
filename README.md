//Purpose//


Back when living out at Arma, i asked a question.

How hard is it to build a 1000+ crate miner like the Gido.

Turns out pretty hard.

This is the result, a personal made miner for my tastes, refining away what i did not need within the Elysium belt while adding some features i needed (or just wanted).

This ship has little autonomy, this means no CAS, no auto approach, no isan.

I am a manual flyer, prefering to navigate the shorter distances around Arma without CAS, and i despise auto approach.

It is also lighter on both prop and fuel than the Gido, this is due to me prefering to do my hauling with dedicated haulers, and leave my miner at stations/cap ships.

Where it excels is speed and carring capacity.

1040 crates leaves more room for chunkers (the Gido would often come short on my last T10, unacceptable)

145 max speed dry, with angled thruster pods to help heep this beast on the straight and narrow, has surprising agility.

This ship is a brute, a massive box surrounded by thrusters, perfect for those who want a manual fly around stations and cap ships without distraction.


A huge thank you to Happytrigger for his free mods, and allowing me to borrow from his Pangasius Bp, this ship would not be without him.

A huge thank you to Zehtuka for allowing me to use the M1K cockpit + turret cradles, this ship started as a mod to the M1K, before starting from scratch.
